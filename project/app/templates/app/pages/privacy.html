        Our privacy policy is fairly simple:  we won't share your information with anyone &mdash; period.  If you expressly opt-in, we will make your signature and comment public on the website; otherwise your information is kept private.  And if you choose to remove your account entirely all information is deleted immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you signed up using your Google, Facebook, or Apple account, that information is used solely for authentication.  We access your name and email once, at registration, and store it on our secured servers in case we need to reach you for adminstrative notices.
      </p>
      <p>
        To remove your account, simply log in and click the "Delete Account" link at the bottom of your account page.   This will fully delete all data (logins, personal information, history, etc.) from our system.
